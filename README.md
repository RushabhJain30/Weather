Use of AI in the Project
This project was partially built with the help of AI-powered development tools:
We used Bolt (AI code assistant) to get suggestions for:
Recommended tech stack based on the problem statement
Boilerplate code for setting up the backend API structure
Sample functions for calling external APIs

After that, we:
Customized the code to match our UI and logic
Integrated the OpenWeatherMap API
Fine-tuned the frontend using React + TypeScript
Hosted the final project on Netlify for easy access

This hybrid approach of AI-assisted development + manual customization helped us:
Speed up the prototyping process
Learn better coding practices
Focus more on creative problem solving and UX
